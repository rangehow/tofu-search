"""tests/test_auth_replay_login_wall.py — a login wall is not a successful fetch.

``fetch_page_content`` used to accept ANY non-empty text from the authenticated
replay:

    auth_text = _try_authenticated_fetch(...)
    if auth_text:
        return auth_text        # ← an SSO login wall lands here

An SSO login wall is a COMPLETE page (the observed one extracts to ~1900 chars,
mostly inlined bootstrap JS), so "non-empty" never distinguished it from real
content. Two consequences, both measured:

  * the caller received the wall AS IF it were the article, and
  * the browser-escalation block right below that ``return`` was UNREACHABLE —
    the very fallback meant to rescue this case could never run.

Root cause shape: judging success by an easy proxy (non-empty) instead of the
real condition (is this the content we asked for). The fix judges the CONTENT
and, when it is a wall, escalates to the host browser; if the browser cannot
take over, it returns a typed diagnosis instead of the wall.

Why cookie re-pasting cannot fix such a site (measured on aigc.sankuai.com):
its auth probe echoes back the ssoid it received, and it echoed EMPTY for every
transport we tried — four cookie namings, host-only and parent scope,
sameSite=None, and a hand-built ``Cookie:`` header. The devtools-visible stored
value is not the value the page transmits (its JS re-assembles the ticket), so
the browser extension (or the site's API) is the only viable path.
