"""Tests for primary-source domain authority (authority.py) and its two
integration points: the BM25 rerank boost and the format.py Authority tag.

The motivating bug: an SEO aggregator (latencycost.com) outranked the vendor's
own pricing page (aws.amazon.com), so the model synthesized a wrong number.
These tests pin the fix: the vendor domain NAMED IN THE QUERY is 'official',
structural docs/registries are 'primary', SEO price-farms are 'aggregator',
and the rerank boost + format tag reflect that.
