"""Guards for the two contracts that make this package safe to embed.

Both are enforced here rather than by convention because both fail SILENTLY and
far from their cause:

1. **stdout stays clean.** A host may run this library inside a process whose
   stdout carries a protocol stream (an MCP stdio server speaks JSON-RPC over
   stdout). One stray write corrupts the stream, and the host reports an
   unparseable message rather than "tofu_search printed something".

2. **One HTTP seam per layer.** Timeouts, the shared User-Agent, retry policy
   and the SSRF guard live in the seam modules. Code that reaches for
   ``requests.get`` directly gets none of them, and the omission is invisible
   until a request hangs forever or resolves an internal address.
