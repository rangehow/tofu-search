"""Offline regression tests for the Race-to-N fetch gate (#8).

The previous implementation re-scanned all of unique_results on every future
completion (O(n²)) to recompute the kept-with-content count. The fix tracks
that count incrementally, scoped to kept URLs. These tests pin the observable
behaviour: the pipeline returns content-bearing results and the fetch count is
correct, with engines + page fetch fully stubbed (no network).
