"""arXiv query-syntax contract — the three facts that cost six zero-recall runs.

These assertions are the executable form of knowledge that previously lived only
in a comment in a downstream application. A comment cannot go red, so the next
person to write arXiv retrieval here would have re-learned all three the hard
way. Each was MEASURED against the live API (2026-07-28) on six real research
ideas; each looked correct in a mock and returned ZERO for all six.

★ Deliberately OFFLINE — zero network. These pin the QUERY STRING we construct,
not what arXiv happens to index today. A networked version would go randomly red
on index drift or an HTTP 429, and a randomly-red guard is indistinguishable
from noise, which is how a broken guard gets ignored for two weeks. Real recall
behaviour belongs in a comparison script, not in a resident guard.
